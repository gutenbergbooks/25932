<h2>NOTE</h2>


<p>Pending the full pre-war history, which is to be
written by better hands, the very sketchy outline in
Part I. is given in order to form the connecting link
between the Regiment in peace, since its formation,
and the present time.</p>

<p>It does not attempt to give the smallest idea of the
hard work, often accomplished under disadvantageous
circumstances, carried out by all ranks, which made
possible the work done in the war.</p>

<p>That the Regiment even now exists is solely due
to Lieut.-Colonel Lord Bingham (now Brigadier-General
the Earl of Lucan), whose cheery optimism
through the dark times previous to the birth of the
Territorial Force was such a great tower of strength.</p>

will be given to the London Rifle Brigade Prisoners'
Aid Fund.</p>

<h2>SHORT HISTORY</h2>

<h3>OF THE</h3>

<h2>LONDON RIFLE BRIGADE</h2>




<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>PART I.</h2>


<div class="sidenote"><b>Formation.</b></div>

<p>The London Rifle Brigade, formerly the 1st
London Volunteer Rifle Corps (City of London
Rifle Volunteer Brigade), and now, officially,
the 5th (City of London) <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Battalion The'">Battalion, The</ins>
London Regiment, London Rifle Brigade,
familiarly known to its members and the public
generally by the sub-title or the abbreviation
"L.R.B.," was founded July 23rd, 1859, at a
meeting convened by the Lord Mayor. It has
always been intimately associated with the City
of London, its companies being under the
patronage of the various Wards.</p>

<p>Within a week of its formation the muster of
the Regiment exceeded 1,800; two battalions
were formed and headquarters were taken at
No. 8, Great Winchester Street, where they remained
for 34 years, and subsequently in
Finsbury Pavement.</p>

<p>In 1893 the Regiment entered its present
headquarters in Bunhill Row. These were de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a><a href="images/o-2.png">[2]</a></span>signed
by the late Lieut.-Colonel Boyes, erected
entirely from regimental funds, supplemented
by contributions from members of the Brigade,
from various City Companies and other friends
of the Regiment, and constitute the finest building
of its kind in London.</p>

<p>Since the formation of the Territorial Force
these headquarters have been shared with the
Post Office Rifles.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Honorary
Colonel.</b></div>

<p>Mr. Alderman Carter was at first appointed
Honorary Colonel, but in 1860 it was suggested
that a military Honorary Colonel would be more
appropriate than a civilian one, and Mr. Carter
(then Lord Mayor) approached H.R.H. the
Duke of Cambridge, who, in response to the
unanimous wish of the Regiment, accepted the
appointment, which he held until his death in
1904. During this period he rarely missed attending
the annual inspection.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Commanding
Officers<ins title="Transcriber's Note: this punctuation missing in original">.</ins></b></div>

<p>In 1862 a resolution was passed at a meeting
"that Regimental Commanding Officers should
now and always be Officers of professional experience
and ability." This tradition has been
departed from on only two occasions prior to
the war, as shown in the list given on the
following page.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a><a href="images/o-3.png">[3]</a></span></p>

</div>


<div class="sidenote"><b>South
African
War.</b></div>

<p>Colonel Cholmondeley was appointed to command
the Mounted Infantry Section of the
C.I.V., to which regiment the London Rifle
Brigade contributed 2 officers (Captain C. G. R.
Matthey and Lieutenant the Hon. Schomberg
K. McDonnell) and 78 other ranks.</p>

<p>When the Volunteer Active Service Companies
were raised, 17 members were accepted
for service with the Royal Fusiliers, and an
additional 76 joined the Imperial Yeomanry
and R.A.M.C.</p>

<p>The total death roll of the Regiment was
seven.</p>

<p>Colonel Cholmondeley, Lieutenant E. D.
Johnson (Imperial Yeomanry), and Colour-Sergeant
T. G. Beeton (C.I.V. Infantry) were mentioned
in despatches.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Honours.</b></div>

<p>Colonel Cholmondeley received the C.B. for
his services in South Africa, and Lieutenant the
Hon. Rupert Guinness was made a C.M.G. for
his work with the Irish Hospital.</p>

<p>When the Coronation honours were announced
in 1902, Colonel Edward Matthey,
V.D., received the C.B., a fitting award for his
long services to the Volunteer Force. Before
joining the L.R.B. in 1873 as a private he had
already been 13 years in the Victoria Rifles. He
retired in 1901, having served in every rank.
His interest in the Regiment has been, and
still is, without limit.</p>


<p>The work he has done for its welfare, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a><a href="images/o-5.png">[5]</a></span>
still serving, and since retirement, cannot be
chronicled here, but, when the full history of
the Regiment is written, Colonel Matthey's
name will be found writ large on its pages.</p>

<i>The Brewery&mdash;The Battalion's First Bath house.</i></span>
</div>


<div class="sidenote"><b>Battle
Honours.</b></div>

<p>In January, 1905, the Regiment was given the
right to bear upon its "Colours and appointments"
the words "South Africa, 1900-1902."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Shooting.</b></div>

<p>The London Rifle Brigade has always been
distinguished as a shooting regiment. In the
very first year of its existence its co-operation
was sought in connection with the formation of
the National Rifle Association. In 1907 it had
no less than a dozen International marksmen in
its ranks.</p>

<p>The earliest notable individual success was
that of Private J. Wyatt, who won the Queen's
Prize in 1864.</p>

<p>On two more occasions has the Blue Riband
of the shooting world been won by members
of the Regiment&mdash;in 1902 by Lieutenant E. D.
Johnson, and in 1909 by Corporal H. G. Burr.</p>

<p>Regimental teams have been very successful
both at the National Rifle Association and the
London district meetings. At the latter the
"Daily Telegraph" Cup was won two years in
succession (1897 and 1898).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>School of
Arms.</b></div>

<p>This was second to none in the Territorial
Force. Its Annual Assault-at-Arms provided
as stirring a spectacle as could be witnessed
anywhere. For many years past the Brigade
achieved notable successes at the Royal Military<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a><a href="images/o-6.png">[6]</a></span>
Tournament and in the competitions of the
Metropolitan Territorial School of Arms Association.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Athletics.</b></div>

<p>The Battalion always took part in the various
contests between the Territorial Regiments with
considerable success. The most notable of late
were the following:&mdash;The "Marathon" Race in
the Territorial Championship of the London
District, 1913, when Captain Husey and the
London Rifle Brigade team won it in the record
time of 1 hr. 33 min. 37 sec.; the distance was 12
miles, from Ewell to Stamford Bridge. The
national contest at Newport did not produce
such a good time, the London Rifle Brigade
team winning it in 1 hr. 48 min. 14 sec.</p>

<p>The march to Brighton of 52&frac12; miles for a
team of sixty of all ranks, in full marching
order, was accomplished in 1914 by a London
Rifle Brigade team, under Captain Husey and
Lieutenant Large, in the record time of 14 hrs.
23 min. The war has not given any other
battalion a chance to lower the latter record,
and it will assuredly take "some doing."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a><a href="images/o-7.png">[7]</a></span></p>
<h2>PART II.</h2>


<div class="sidenote"><b>Mobilisation.</b></div>

<p>The Battalion mobilised on the outbreak of
war. It had actually gone into camp at Eastbourne,
but was brought back to London within
a few hours of its arrival.</p>

<p>A second and third Battalion were soon
formed. (See pp. 30, 31.)</p>


<div class='center'><br /><span class="smcap">First Battalion.</span></div>

<p>Making stays of varying duration en route at
Wimbledon, Hersham, and Bisley (for three
weeks), the 1st Battalion finally reached Crowborough,
where it remained under canvas until
ordered abroad.</p>

<p>It embarked on November 4th, 1914. The
following were the officers:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang1'>Lieut.-Col. W. D. Earl Cairns (Commanding).</div>

<div class='hang1'>Lieut.-Col. (Hon. Col.) C. G. R. Matthey,
V.D. (Second-in-Command).</div>

<div class='hang1'>Major.&mdash;N. C. King, T.D.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Captains.&mdash;A. S. Bates, M. H. Soames, R. H.
Husey, C. H. F. Thompson, H. F.
MacGeagh, J. R. Somers-Smith, A. L.
Lintott, and Hon. Major C. D. Burnell.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Lieutenants.&mdash;R. E. Otter, J. G. Robinson, G. H.
Morrison, E. L. Large, P. A. Slessor, H. B.
Price, A. G. Kirby, G. H. Cholmeley.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a><a href="images/o-8.png">[8]</a></span></div>

<div class='hang1'>Second-Lieutenants.&mdash;K. Forbes, G. H. G. M.
Cartwright, W. L. Willett, H. L. Johnston,
C. W. Trevelyan, H. G. Vincent, G. E. S.
Fursdon, G. C. Kitchin.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Adjutant.&mdash;Captain A. C. Oppenheim, K.R.R.C.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Quartermaster.&mdash;Lieutenant J. R. S. Petersen.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Medical Officer.&mdash;Major A. D. Ducat, T.D.</div>

<p>The following short account is written in
constant remembrance of the censorship regulations,
and with a view to giving a faint outline
of its doings to those who were not out with the
1st Battalion in France. It will be an aid to
memory to those who were with it, and are
fortunate in being able to look back on a time
when the 1st Battalion undoubtedly reached its
zenith.</p>

<p>Never can any Battalion of the Regiment be
better than was the 1st London Rifle Brigade in
1914-15. That all will endeavour to be as good
is quite certain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>1914.
Nov. 5th.</b></div>

<p>The Battalion arrived in France. Disembarkation
was a tedious business, and the progress
through the town to the rest camp at the
top of the hill was one of the worst forms of
route march the Battalion had ever experienced.
Frequent checks, but no halts, taught
the true weight of packs and kit; and a perfunctory
inspection on arrival at the camp completed
the exhaustion.</p>

<p>For the next three weeks the history of the
Battalion was one common to those Territorial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a><a href="images/o-9.png">[9]</a></span>
units which were sent out as lone Battalions
about that time. It comprised a glorious uncertainty,
which troops coming out earlier and
later in complete divisions cannot have experienced.
For instance, on landing it was learnt,
quite by accident, but on excellent authority,
that officers no longer wore Sam Browne belts or
carried swords. A frantic rush at the last
moment procured web equipment just before
the parade to entrain. Swords and belts were
left at the base.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Nov. 6th.</b></div>

<p>There was much to learn about entrainment
in France. An advance party had been sent
forward some two hours earlier, and the rest of
the Battalion and the transport were at the
station by 4 p.m. The train was not due to
leave until 9 p.m. French trains and the French
railway system became familiar later on in all
their ramifications, but at first "Hommes 40
Chevaux (en long) 8" aroused suspicions that
were only too well justified in the next 21&frac12; hours
before the train reached its destination. The
experience was not a unique one.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Nov. 7th.</b></div>

<p>On arrival at General Headquarters it was
found that the Battalion was not even expected,
and no arrangements had been made for the
night. After a wait of three hours in the train,
the Battalion moved off into some old artillery
barracks, which were destined to become more
familiar later on. The quarters were, at that
time, about as dismal and dirty as can be
imagined.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><a href="images/o-10.png">[10]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Nov. 8th.</b></div>

<p>The Battalion marched out some three and a
half miles to a large unfurnished and unfinished
convent, which accommodated the entire
strength.</p>

<p>There was no water laid on, no light, no
method of heating or of drying clothes, no furniture,
and no possibility of supplementing
rations. The only bright spot was the first introduction
to the rum ration.</p>

<p>Training, which consisted chiefly of trench
digging and artillery formation, was carried out
daily regardless of the weather.</p>

<p>The Battalion was apparently considered to
be up to the required standard of efficiency and
hardness, or else the authorities had not the
heart to keep it there longer, for on the 15th
orders were received to march the next day.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Nov. 16th.</b></div>

<p>The distance was 17&frac12; miles, and the roads
<i>pav&eacute;e</i> almost the whole way. There was also
some rain. In spite, however, of the absence of
other Battalions to keep them on their mettle,
not a single man fell out of the column.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Nov. 17th.</b></div>

<p>Except for bruised feet, the march next day,
about 11 miles, was not very trying. Two
nights were spent at this town, where the Artists
and Honourable Artillery Company were also
in billets.</p>

<p>While on the march it had been possible, for
the first time, to see aeroplanes being shelled,
and, while in these billets, the Battalion learnt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><a href="images/o-11.png">[11]</a></span>
what it meant to see the remnants of a Brigade
come out of action.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Nov. 19th.</b></div>

<p>The Battalion moved one stage nearer to
the firing line in a snow-storm.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Nov. 20th.</b></div>

<p>Brigadier-General Hunter Weston paid the
Battalion a visit, and addressed the Officers.
He gave a short account of the 11th Infantry
Brigade, which he commanded, and to which the
London Rifle Brigade was attached, and outlined
the scheme of training. Half-companies
were to be attached to Regular Battalions for a
spell in the trenches, the men being scattered
amongst the Regulars. As soon as their worth
had been proved, half-companies were to be
put in the line intact, and later whole companies.</p>

<p>At dusk on this date half the Battalion proceeded
vi&acirc; Ploegsteert to the trenches.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Nov. 21st.</b></div>

<p>For some unknown reason the Battalion had
not been permitted to adopt the "double company
system" in England, but on this date the
change was made with half the Battalion absent
in the trenches.</p>

<p>"A" and "D" Companies became No. 1,
under Major King.</p>

<p>"E" and "O" Companies became No. 2,
under Captain Soames.</p>

<p>"G" and "P" Companies became No. 3,
under Major Burnell.</p>

<p>"H" and "Q" Companies became No. 4,
under Captain Bates.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><a href="images/o-12.png">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>For the purposes of reference, these companies
will be referred to as A, B, C, and D
respectively, though, owing to the confusion
that might have arisen with the old letters, this
nomenclature was not actually adopted till after
the second battle of Ypres.</p>

<p>Up to December 18th the trench training of
the London Rifle Brigade continued. Platoons
and whole companies, gradually working more
and more on their own, were attached to the
Regulars. When not actually in the line, the
whole day was invariably taken up with
"fatigues" of all kinds.</p>

<p>A support line in the wood was remade and
named Bunhill Row.</p>

<p>It was during this period that the Battalion
gained the nicknames "London fatigue party"
or "Fatigue Fifth," and other affectionate titles
which would not look well in print.</p>

<p>The Battalion also learnt what it meant to
have the "dripping swung on it."</p>

<p>The 11th Infantry Brigade was composed of
the following Battalions:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
1st Somerset Light Infantry.<br />
1st East Lancashire Regiment.<br />
1st Hampshire Regiment.<br />
1st Rifle Brigade.<br />
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Dec. 19th.</b></div>

<p>The object of the attack by the 11th Infantry
Brigade in front of Ploegsteert Wood on this
date was to clear its edges, including German<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a><a href="images/o-13.png">[13]</a></span>
House, and, if possible, establish a line in front
in the part afterwards known as the "birdcage."</p>



<div class="figleft" style="width: 303px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap"><a href="images/i-05.jpg">Ploegsteert Wood.</a></span></span>
</div>


<p>The Somerset Light Infantry and Rifle Brigade
attacked. The London Rifle Brigade was
in support. The weather could not have been
worse, and the ground was impossible. The
result was that the wood was cleared, and
German House remained in No Man's Land.</p>

<p>The London Rifle Brigade was not called
upon to continue the attack. This was the
first experience the Battalion had of anything
like heavy artillery fire, and also of the difficulty
of consolidating at night in an unknown bit of
ground. Two half-companies were engaged in
assisting in this work, while the rest of the
Battalion spent a miserable night in the marshes
in the wood.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Dec. 23rd.</b></div>

<p>Each of the four companies was definitely
attached, as a fifth company, to one of the
Regular Battalions&mdash;"A" to the East Lancs,
"B" to the Somerset Light Infantry, "C" to
the Hants, and "D" to the Rifle Brigade.</p>

<p>All four companies of the London Rifle Brigade
being in the front line on the same night,
it so happened that before the end of 1914 a
Territorial Battalion held the whole of a Regular
Brigade's front with the exception of half a
company on the extreme left.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>1915.</b></div>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Jan. 5th.</b></div>

<p>The London Rifle Brigade was taken out of
the trenches preparatory to taking over a bit of
line of its own on the right of the 11th Brigade.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><a href="images/o-14.png">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Owing to the incursions of the river Warnave,
this trench was in a very poor state of repair and
badly flooded.</p>

<p>The dispositions of the Battalion were&mdash;one
company in the front trench, one in London
Farm and its environs (this supplied the night-carrying
and working parties), one company,
which was used for general fatigues for the
Brigade, in reserve in Ploegsteert, and one company
resting, washing, and cleaning in billets
at Armenti&egrave;res. Every company spent three
days in each place, and in many ways this was
the most comfortable tour of duty the Battalion
ever had.</p>

<p>The men made themselves thoroughly at
home in the cottages of the village, while the
three days' rest in Armenti&egrave;res owed much of
its enjoyment to the initiative shown by the 4th
Division in organising both divisional baths and
divisional Follies.</p>

<p>Headquarters and various details, which included
for the first time a permanent working
and wiring party, were, of course, always "in
action" in Ploegsteert.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Mar. 11th&mdash;20th.</b></div>

<p>This was a period of "standing by" and
various small moves, but eventually, after three
days in the East Lancashires' trenches in front
of the Convent, the Battalion took over the
centre section in the wood on the 21st March.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Earl Cairns, C.M.G., owing
to ill-health, left the Battalion on March 16th,
and Major A. S. Bates took over command.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a><a href="images/o-15.png">[15]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Mar. 21st&mdash;Apl.
17th.</b></div>

<p>The section was held with three companies
in the wood, and the fourth in reserve in the
village. The other battalions of the 11th Brigade
went into rest on the 16th, and the London
Rifle Brigade came out last on the next day.
The 11th Infantry Brigade was relieved by a
brigade of the South Midland Division.</p>

<p>The following extract from a letter shows the
change of conditions between the first and
second sojourn of the Battalion in the wood:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We are back again in the wood, and really
almost glad, though I expect you will hardly
believe it. Our quota of work in the winter no
doubt did a good deal towards the transformation,
and spring is now helping matters. The
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'couduroy'">corduroy</ins> no longer stops at the worst parts,
where we used to hold our breaths and make a
dive for it. Hunter Avenue, and right beyond
it to the end of the wood, is now quite a
pleasant walk. Rations and carrying parties,
though they have developed a rather peculiar
gait, can progress at a reasonable pace, and have
no need to wade so long as they keep to the
boards. On either side, however, we still have
a reminder of the nightmare that is past. The
possibility of getting material up has a corresponding
effect on the work in the trenches.
The trench we were in on December 9th, which
we could not conceive ever being anything but
a drain, has now found its proper use. It has a
new C.T. behind, and breastworks pushed out
in front into the hedge, with little bridges across<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a><a href="images/o-16.png">[16]</a></span>
to each; so that altogether everything in the
garden is as near lovely as can be."</p>

<p>The Bishop of London, the Senior Chaplain
to the Regiment, during his visit to the front,
came to Ploegsteert on April 3rd, and celebrated
Holy Communion for the Battalion on
Easter Sunday. He also consecrated the Battalion's
graveyard in the village.</p>

<p>His regret at not being allowed to see the
members of the Battalion in the trenches was
shared by all ranks.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>April 17th.</b></div>

<p>Two brigades had been withdrawn to the
neighbourhood of Steenwerck by this date, and
the 4th Division started its first period of rest
since the Retreat.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>April 24th.</b></div>

<p>Orders were received on the 22nd for these
brigades to be ready to move at an hour's
notice. The London Rifle Brigade actually
entrained at mid-day on the 24th, and spent
the night in billets outside Poperinghe, moving
off at 5.30 a.m. next morning to the outskirts
of Vlamertinghe. It stopped there till 6 p.m.,
when it paraded with the rest of the Brigade
(less the East Lancashires) to go into the
Salient.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Second
Battle of
Ypres.</b></div>

<p>Since the first gas attack on the evening of
April 22nd, little definite information had been
available as to the situation between the left
of the 28th Division (some 1,000 yards N.N.E.
of Zonnebeke) and along the whole north side
of the Salient down to the canal near<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><a href="images/o-17.png">[17]</a></span>
Boesinghe. The Canadians had held on with
the grimmest determination in the neighbourhood
of St. Julian, while what became to be
known as Geddes' force held the line from the
canal up to the Canadians. Geddes' force consisted
originally of the supports and reserves
(isolated companies and battalions) from the
south and east sides of the Salient. By the
night of the 25th this force had been supplemented
by the 10th Brigade, the Northumbrian
Territorial Division, the Lahore Division, and
the 13th Brigade from the 5th Division.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><b>April 25th.</b></div>

<p>The 11th Brigade was ordered on this night
to join up the left of the 28th Division with the
right of the 10th Brigade, and so relieve the
Canadians, who were still holding out in the
neighbourhood of St. Julian.</p>

<p>No information was forthcoming as to the
location of either of these forces, and it would
seem that, instead of one continuous line, there
were many small parties holding out in isolated
groups.</p>

<p>Two officers from each Battalion had been
sent up in advance (Captain Husey and Lieutenant
Johnston from the London Rifle Brigade),
but no available information could be
collected, except that there was apparently a
gap.</p>



<div class="figleft" style="width: 238px;">

<i>11th May, 1915.</i></span>
</div>


<p>That night the Hants joined up with the
28th Division, and prolonged the line nearly to
the junction of the Zonnebeke-St. Julian and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><a href="images/o-18.png">[18]</a></span>
Ypres-Passchendale roads. There was, however,
still a gap of nearly 1,000 yards between
its left and the rest of the Brigade which had
prolonged the line from the right of the 10th
Brigade and part of the Northumbrian Division.</p>

<p>The London Rifle Brigade, being in support,
had been instructed to dig itself in 600 yards
south-east of Fortuin.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>April 26th.</b></div>

<p>The Battalion did not reach this position
until 1.45 a.m., but, thanks to an early morning
mist, it was able to secure fairly good cover by
daylight.</p>

<p>On this day, and daily for the next seven
days, the Battalion was heavily shelled, and
suffered a high percentage of casualties, chiefly
from enfilade fire.</p>

<p>Orders were received for a company to move
early in the afternoon and take up a position
that would join up the gap existing between the
Somerset Light Infantry and the Hants. "C"
Company was detailed, but a personal reconnaissance
by the Officer Commanding the Company
(Major Burnell) convinced higher authority that
it was not only impossible to move the men by
day, but that the Hants' left could not be found.
Orders were accordingly received for the whole
Battalion to move at dusk into the gap. Moving
by a somewhat circuitous route, it arrived
at its position, and dug in for the second night
in succession. Owing to the darkness, most, if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a><a href="images/o-19.png">[19]</a></span>
not all, of the rules as to "artillery formation"
were of necessity transgressed on this occasion.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/gs31.jpg" width="600" height="358" alt="Yser Canal." title="Yser Canal." />
<span class="caption"><a href="images/i-07.jpg"><span class="smcap">Yser Canal.</span></a></span>
</div>



<p>The left of its line joined the Somersets, and
the right an isolated party on the Zonnebeke-St.
Julian road, which was supporting the Hants'
left some 500 yards further forward to the right
front.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>April 28th.</b></div>

<p>It was not until this night that the Rifle Brigade
finally dug across and joined up with the
Hants, so that there was once more a continuous
line.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>April 29th.</b></div>

<p>The London Rifle Brigade, having now become
the second line, was moved up on this
night to relieve the 4th East Yorks. The latter,
with the 4th Yorks, were split up among the
Battalions of the 11th Brigade, two companies
of the latter being attached to the London
Rifle Brigade. (The East Lancs had rejoined
the Brigade by this time.)</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>May 2nd.</b></div>

<p>About 5 p.m., under cover of very heavy shell
fire and gas, the Germans advanced from the
ridge beyond the Haanebeke stream into the
dead ground on the near side of the stream,
where they dug in some 300 yards away, though
on the left they got up much closer under cover
of the houses.</p>

<p>The London Rifle Brigade casualties were
very heavy, especially on the right, where the
ground was more open.</p>

<p>Though the Battalion was affected by the gas
for about 10 minutes, there was sufficient wind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a><a href="images/o-20.png">[20]</a></span>
to dissipate it before any serious damage was
done.</p>



<div class="figleft" style="width: 231px;">

<i>20th May, 1915.</i></span>
</div>


<p>There is no doubt that, during their advance
from about 1,000 yards till they got into dead
ground, the Germans suffered fairly heavy
casualties from the rifle fire of the two companies
on the right, and this may possibly have
deterred them from trying to leave the dead
ground. With the assistance of the two companies
of the 4th Yorks and one company of the
East Lancs, which was also attached to the
Battalion, the damage to the trenches was
almost all repaired during the night, and all
the wounded were evacuated.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>May 3rd.</b></div>

<p>On this night the line was readjusted, and
the whole Brigade retired through the new line
in rear without a single casualty.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>May 4th.</b></div>

<p>The actual withdrawal commenced at
12.45 a.m., commencing from the right of Battalions.
Wieltje was timed to be reached at
1.45 a.m.</p>

<p>The casualties over the period April 25th to
May 4th were 16 officers and 392 other ranks.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>May 4th&mdash;8th.</b></div>

<p>These days were spent at various places in
the woods behind Vlamertinghe resting, reorganising,
and dealing with accumulations of
mail.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>May 9th.</b></div>

<p>The Battalion moved early in the morning to
the grounds of the Chateau at Vlamertinghe.
On this night and the next one it had to dig on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><a href="images/o-21.png">[21]</a></span>
the east side of the canal on the north of La

<p>The Battalion moved up to the canal bank,
and occupied some very insanitary dug-outs,
which had not been previously inhabited by
British troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>May 12th.</b></div>

<p>The London Rifle Brigade took over from the
Dublins a section of the front line, and was on
the extreme right of the 4th Division. A
Cavalry Division was on its immediate right.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>May 13th.</b></div>

<p>Extract from Sir John French's despatch:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"On the 13th May the heaviest bombardment
yet experienced broke out at 4.30 a.m., and continued
with little intermission throughout the
day.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The 5th London Regiment, despite
very heavy casualties, maintained their position
unfalteringly."</p></div>

<p>Extract from John Buchan's "History of the
War," Vol. VII.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Early in the morning of Thursday, May
13th, a day of biting north winds and drenching
rains, a terrific bombardment began.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The
infantry on the left of the cavalry were fiercely
attacked, but contrived to hold their own.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The London Rifle Brigade had lost most of its
men in the earlier fighting. It began the day
278 strong, and before evening 91 more had
gone. One piece of breastwork was held by
Sergeant Douglas Belcher with four survivors
and two Hussars, whom he had picked up, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><a href="images/o-22.png">[22]</a></span>
though the trench was blown in, and the Germans
attacked with their infantry, he succeeded
in bluffing the enemy by rapid fire, and holding
the ground until relief came. That gallant
stand, for which the Victoria Cross was
awarded, saved the right of the 4th Division.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p></div>

<p>"A" and part of "B" Companies were in the
front line. "C" Company garrisoned three
fortified supporting points. The rest of "B"
Company and "D" were in support. The reinforcement
of the front line commenced at about
8 a.m. (the shelling on the Battalion's sector had
started at 4 a.m.). The distance between the
front line and the supports was about 900 yards.</p>

<p>The shelling did not cease till 6 p.m. Later
in the evening the Battalion was withdrawn to
the second line.</p>

<p>Captain Oppenheim, D.S.O., was wounded on
this date, and Lieutenant H. L. Johnston took
over the duties of Adjutant. He was subsequently
confirmed in the appointment, and
held it till April 7th, 1916, when he took over
command of a company, being succeeded by
Captain F. H. Wallis.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>May 14th.</b></div>

<p>This evening the Battalion moved into the
trenches in front of La Brique, which it had dug
less than a week before.</p>

<p>Orders were received that the London Rifle
Brigade was to be withdrawn and sent the next
day to General Headquarters. The Battalion
marched that evening to Vlamertinghe, and was
billeted there.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>May 20th.</b></div>

<p>The Battalion marched past the Divisional
Commander after he had inspected it, and expressed
his deep appreciation of all it had done
since April 25th. It boarded the motor-buses,
and proceeded to General Headquarters.</p>

<p>The London Rifle Brigade thus left the 4th
Division after six months.</p>

<p>The Brigade, Divisional, and Corps Commanders
had all personally thanked the Battalion
for the work it had done, and congratulated
it on its behaviour under the most trying circumstances.
But perhaps even more valued
were the farewell letters from the Battalions of
the 11th Brigade, showing, as they did, that they
really felt the London Rifle Brigade to have
become part of their Regular Brigade.</p>

<p>The London Rifle Brigade arrived at
Tatinghem, and enjoyed ten days' complete
rest during perfect weather.</p>

<p>The Rangers and Kensingtons had also been
withdrawn from the line.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><a href="images/o-24.png">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>These three Battalions were amalgamated
for work on lines of communications. This
entailed the handing over of all the active service
equipment, and also all transport. The
latter was a bitter blow, as the work of the
transport, personnel, and animals had been
beyond all praise. It is worth noting that in
spite of the very heavy work of the previous
four weeks the transport had actually accomplished
the thirty-mile trek from the Salient in
under 20 hours.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Lines of
Communication.</b></div>

<div class="sidenote"><b>June 1st&mdash;Oct.
1st.</b></div>

<p>This period calls for no detailed treatment.
Headquarters, and the balance of the men not
employed at the different railheads, remained at
St. Omer, first in the artillery barracks, and
from July 1st under canvas.</p>

<p>The numbers at the various railheads altered
very considerably from time to time, e.g., on
June 6th 210 other ranks were scattered over
fifteen stations, and on September 24th there
were 374 other ranks at twenty-one different
stations.</p>

<p>In addition to these details, the Battalion was
called upon to furnish escorts and large parties
for detraining work.</p>

<p>During the battle of Loos the Kensingtons
and London Rifle Brigade between them furnished
all the escorts for German prisoners,
every available man, including grooms and
officers' servants, being used.</p>

<p>The variety of the work on lines of communication
provided scope for every type of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><a href="images/o-25.png">[25]</a></span>
individual&mdash;clerks to R.T.O.'s, telephone operators,
guards, shell fuse setters, navvies on coal
wharves, caretakers of a horse rest camp, hospital
orderlies&mdash;while from time to time at small
stations non-commissioned officers were left in
complete charge.</p>

<p>On August 9th the composite Battalion was
broken up, and each unit regained its individuality.
This did not make any practical
difference until October 2nd, when the London
Rifle Brigade was transferred from the lines of
communication to General Headquarters troops,
and marched to Blendecques, the band of the
Artists being kindly lent by their Commanding
Officer to play it out.</p>

<p>While the Battalion was under canvas at
General Headquarters, the officers messed in the
Salle d'Honneur of the 8th Regiment of Infantry.
On leaving, a present of a glass inkpot, with the
regimental crest of the London Rifle Brigade,
was sent to this French regiment as a small
memento of the occasion. A most cordial and
charming reply was received by Colonel Bates
from Colonel Roubert, in which the latter looked
forward to seeing the London Rifle Brigade
once again in his barracks after victory had
crowned the Allies' arms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><a href="images/o-26.png">[26]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Oct. 2nd&mdash;25th.</b></div>

<p>The stay at Blendecques was intended to be a
period of training before being sent back to the
front. The actual period was 23 days, but, as it
took more than a week to collect all the details
from the various railheads, little more than a
fortnight's full training was possible.</p>

<p>The reluctance of the authorities at these railheads
to part with their London Rifle Brigade
detachments, even after their reliefs had
arrived, although complimentary, was not a little
annoying, but the grateful letters received by
the Commanding Officer in some measure compensated
for the delay.</p>

<p>These three weeks were a period of remobilisation.
Most of the non-commissioned
officers who had survived Ypres had taken commissions.
All the specialists had to be retrained.
The transport and detailed equipment
had to be indented for. The essentials were received
by degrees, and actually completed a few
days before the Battalion moved.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Oct. 25th.</b></div>

<p>The London Rifle Brigade moved by motor-bus
in pouring rain to join the 3rd Division,
which was resting east of Cassel. It relieved
the Honourable Artillery Company in the 8th
Infantry Brigade. The latter Battalion returned
in the same buses. The transport had marched
on the previous day.</p>

<p>Incessant rain and frequent inspections, combined
with training on the lines laid down by
the new Division, employed the time up to
November 23rd.</p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a><a href="images/o-27.png">[27]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Nov. 23rd.</b></div>

<p>The Battalion marched to Poperinghe. For
the first time it now had a bombing section of
2 officers and 70 other ranks; a sniping detachment
was also organised.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Nov. 29th.</b></div>

<p>The Battalion relieved the Liverpool Scottish
in the front line. The trenches were in a
desperate state, with very few traverses, no
complete communication trenches or second
line, and mud quite indescribable. They were
also overlooked, and enfiladed by the enemy.
The tour was normally seven days, with two
companies in the front line and two in reserve
near Battalion Headquarters.</p>

<p>Work was rendered very difficult owing to the
water-logged nature of the ground.</p>

<p>Ration parties took as much as seven hours to
accomplish one round journey.</p>

<p>On the whole, the Battalion was amazingly
fortunate while in these trenches. It suffered
casualties from occasional shelling and sniping,
but on certainly two occasions the enemy
bombarded the trenches and blew in fifty yards
of parapet without inflicting a single casualty.</p>

<p>The march to and from the trenches was an
exceedingly trying one. Only once was part of
the Battalion able to use motor-buses, but, after
the first tour, use was made of the "Ypres Express,"
to whose Commanding Officer the London
Rifle Brigade will ever remain indebted.</p>

<p>The Battalion was in the trenches during the
abortive gas attack on December 19th, but was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a><a href="images/o-28.png">[28]</a></span>
not affected by the gas, which passed just
behind it.</p>

<p>Christmas Day was spent in Poperinghe.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>1916.</b></div>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Jan. 4th.</b></div>

<p>On leaving the trenches on this date the Battalion
was kept in Brigade reserve. Apart from
heavy night-working parties, the week was not
too uncomfortable, though baths were impossible.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Jan. 18th.</b></div>

<p>The London Rifle Brigade returned to rest
under canvas instead of to billets.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Feb. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads '1&mdash;8.'">1st&mdash;8th.</ins></b></div>

<p>Owing to the relief of the 3rd Division this
period was one of variety. The Battalion
marched from trenches to rest, and back into
reserve. It was attached to three different Brigades,
and for a time was Divisional Troops.
Eventually, on the 8th, orders were received to
entrain the next day. The various outlying details
were collected before midnight.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Feb. 9th.</b></div>

<p>The Battalion entrained for the South.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b>Gommecourt.</b></div>

<div class="sidenote"><b>July 1st.</b></div>

<p>This fighting is too recent for any details,
however bare, to be given.</p>

<p>Previous to this date the Battalion, now part
of as fine a Territorial Division as France had
ever seen, took its ordinary tour of training
and trenches. It was, of course, known that
the Division was going "over the top" at the
beginning of the offensive, and all training was
carried out with this great end in view.</p>

<p>The following extract from the account published
in the Press is given here, not because the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a><a href="images/o-29.png">[29]</a></span>
writer of these notes does not feel able to give
his own account, but because he might unwittingly
say more than the Censor would feel able
to pass:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I am about to give, on first-hand information,
an account of the part which has been
played by certain of our famous London Regiments.
These regiments, which included the
London Rifle Brigade, the Queen Victoria's
Rifles, the Rangers, the Queen's Westminsters,
and London Scottish, had assigned to them certain
objectives near Gommecourt, towards the
northern end of our original line of advance,
where, as is well known, owing to the extraordinary
preparations which the enemy had
made in that direction, we did not fare so well
as we have done, and continue to do, further
south. The London Regiments, which fought
with magnificent gallantry and tenacity, did, in
fact, accomplish their primary objects, but,
owing to circumstances beyond their control,
they subsequently had to retire to a line which
nearly corresponds to that they occupied before
the battle began.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p></div>

<p>For its work on this day the Corps, of which
the Division formed a part, received a special
verbal message of thanks, delivered by one of
Sir Douglas Haig's A.D.C.'s. This was subsequently
confirmed in writing by the Chief of
the General Staff.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a><a href="images/o-30.png">[30]</a></span></p>

<i>November, 1915&mdash;February, 1916.</i></span>
</div>





<p>Lieut.-Colonel Bates, D.S.O., was given sick
leave in August, and Major R. H. Husey, M.C.,
took command. Under his leadership the Battalion
added to its laurels in the fighting during
September.</p>


<div class='center'><br />SECOND BATTALION.</div>

<p>At the beginning of September, 1914, permission
was obtained to form a second Battalion.
Recruiting was commenced at Headquarters in
Bunhill Row on the 3rd, and the Battalion was
filled in one day. So great was the rush of recruits
that, had it been possible to obtain leave
to do so, another Battalion could easily have
been formed. Great care was taken, under
these advantageous circumstances, in the selection
of recruits. Those taken, combined with
the draft from the 1st Battalion of men who
were unable at that time to undertake the
foreign service obligation, made up a fine Battalion.</p>

<p>Of the officers on formation, the following had
formerly served in the Regiment, or were serving,
and transferred from the 1st Battalion under
the home service condition:&mdash;</p>

<div class='hang1'>Lieut.-Colonel G. R. Tod, formerly Adjutant
for five years, 1898-1903.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Major G. Harvest.</div>
<div><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><a href="images/o-31.png">[31]</a></span></div>
<div class='hang1'>Quartermaster and Hon. Major J. Guppy.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Captain C. G. H. Macgill, M.V.O., who
acted as Adjutant until the formation of
the Home Service Provisional Battalion.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Captain S. Bowers.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Captain C. R. Bland.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Captain H. B. Prior.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Captain C. E. Johnstone.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Captain C. Furze.</div>

<div class='hang1'>Lieutenant B. E. Bland.</div>

<span class="caption"><span class='smcap'><a href="images/i-19.jpg">Entrance to Camp, Rest Billets, May, 1916, where the Lord Mayor saw the Battalion on Parade.</a></span></span>
</div>

<div class='center'><br />THIRD BATTALION.</div>

<p>The 3rd Battalion was raised on November
30th, 1914. The first Commanding Officer was
Colonel H. C. Cholmondeley, C.B. (see pages 3
and 4). The Battalion was fortunate in having
the help of several old members of the Regiment
in the commissioned and non-commissioned
ranks. They were invaluable in carrying on to
the new men the traditions and &eacute;sprit de corps
of the London Rifle Brigade.</p>

<p>After some five months in London, the Battalion
proceeded at the end of April by train to
Wimbledon, and on, by route march, to Tadworth,
where it went under canvas. Soon after
its arrival Colonel Cholmondeley was given command
of a 4th Line Brigade, and the command
of the Battalion was taken over by Major
Norman C. King, T.D., who went out to the
front with the 1st Battalion, and had been
invalided home. Lieut.-Colonel King, being the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><a href="images/o-32.png">[32]</a></span>
officer with the senior permanent rank on the
cadre of the Regiment, now commands it.</p>

<p>The system of training adopted was that of a
public school; that is to say, the company represented
the house, and the Captain the house
master, who administered the company, but was
not responsible for its training. The instructors
in each subject&mdash;e.g., drill, musketry, bombing,
etc.&mdash;each had their own staff of assistants, and
every platoon was taken up in turn for its lesson.
This represented the forms of a school. The
system proved very successful, and received
commendation from high authority. It was subsequently
recommended for adoption over the
whole of the Southern Command, but was too
much of a departure from tradition to be taken
over as it stood, though it was recommended in
a modified form.</p>

<p>As the summer of 1915 passed on, officers
from the 1st Battalion, who had been wounded
in the second battle of Ypres in April-May, were
posted to the 3rd Battalion on recovery.
Thus began the circulation between the 1st and
3rd Battalions which has proved so invaluable in
keeping close touch and sympathy between
those at the front and those at home.</p>

<p>On November 12th the Battalion moved to
billets in Sutton, and received the greatest kindness
and consideration there. Everything possible
was done for the comfort of the Battalion,
and not the least of the kindnesses received<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><a href="images/o-33.png">[33]</a></span>
were the services at Christchurch, under the Rev.
Courtney Gale. Nothing could have exceeded
the warmth and vigour of the church parades,
which were much appreciated by all ranks.</p>

<p>On January 10th, 1916, the Battalion moved
to its present camp.</p>


<div class='center'><br />ADMINISTRATIVE CENTRE.</div>

<p>The Headquarters and Dep&ocirc;t or Administrative
Centre are situated at 130, Bunhill Row,
E.C., and are in charge of Captain H. Ferguson,
to whom the Regiment owes a considerable debt
of gratitude for the whole-hearted way he has
thrown himself into the work since he joined.
Having been private secretary to the late Lord
Roberts, he has brought a ripe knowledge and
warm appreciation of the Territorial Force to
bear on the thousand and one details which have
to be arranged from Headquarters. Here it is
that recruits receive their equipment and their
first insight into drill.</p>

<p>The finances of the Regiment since war
broke out have been ably looked after by Major
C. W. Cornish, V.D., who took up the reins
again after having laid them down in 1908.</p>

<p>The London Rifle Brigade Mutual Aid
Society centres in Bunhill Row, and a copy of
its scheme is given in Appendix F.</p>

<p>The Prisoners' Aid Fund, for sending food
and warm clothing to non-commissioned officers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><a href="images/o-34.png">[34]</a></span>
and riflemen of the Regiment who are prisoners,
is also controlled from Headquarters. Weekly
parcels are sent by ladies of the Regiment to
any whose relatives are not in a position to send
them all they require.</p>

<h3><i>Commissions.</i></h3>


<p>Since the 1st Battalion landed in France, 535 of its
non-commissioned officers and men have received
commissions.</p>

<p>The majority of these were sent to the Cadet
School at General Headquarters or to England, while
the balance, just over 200, obtained their commissions
when at home sick or recovering from wounds. Out
of this number 65 (21 of "A," 20 of "B," 15 of "C,"
and 9 of "D" Companies) have been given commissions
in the Regiment, and 30 of these received them
direct in the field in the 1st Battalion.</p>

<p>For a Regiment, whose 1st Battalion was fighting,
the total given below is a proud achievement. It was
always a wrench to part with candidates, but the
figures prove that the strictures, often heard, that
Commanding Officers refused to part with their best
men were unfounded in the case of the London Rifle
Brigade.</p>

<p>A few commissions were granted before the 1st Battalion
went abroad, but no details are, at present,
available.</p>

the war, or to aid their dependants.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><a href="images/o-48.png">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The Fund is administered by a Committee of
five members, two of whom have been nominated by
